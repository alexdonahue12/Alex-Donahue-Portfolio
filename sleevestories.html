<!-- PROJECT BRIEF -->

      <h2>Project brief</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, I was tasked with creating a short-term identity system
        for a Milwaukee Art Museum exhibit centered on a theme from Communication
        Design history.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose to explore the evolution of album cover design, a visual art form
        that captures the intersection of music, culture, and design innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge was to design a cohesive system that honors the analog legacy
        of album artwork while appealing to modern audiences. The identity needed
        to reflect music’s visual storytelling power, bridging eras of vinyl, CD,
        and streaming culture into one unified aesthetic.

    <!-- RESEARCH / IDEATION -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="case-panel">
        <h2>Research &amp; early directions</h2>
        <p>
          I began by researching how album artwork evolved from the 1950s onward,
          studying designers like Reid Miles, Peter Saville, and Storm Thorgerson.
          These references helped me understand how typography, color, and composition
          communicated not just the music but an artist’s entire persona.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure visual consistency across all pieces, I developed a cohesive design
          system that unified the project’s type, color, and layout rules. I began by
          creating three distinct concepts for the major deliverables: poster, mailer,
          ticket, and banner, each exploring different ways to visualize the relationship
          between music and design. Using moodboards and hand-drawn sketches, I tested
          how imagery, hierarchy, and rhythm could connect the identity across print,
          digital, and 3D applications
        </p>
        <p>
          After evaluating each direction, I selected the strongest concept and refined
          it into a flexible system. This included consistent use of the vinyl gradient
          motif, bold sans-serif typography, and the album cover grid background, which
          together maintained a unified visual voice throughout every element of the campaign.
        </p>

    <!-- DESIGN SYSTEM -->

          <h2>Design system</h2>
          <p>
            The final logo centers on a geometric circle, evoking a record,
            paired with a bold square that acts as the “sleeve,” visually
            representing the title Sleeve Stories. For texture and depth,
            I designed a watermark-style background grid of iconic album covers,
            set to low opacity. This subtle collage connects the exhibit to its
            subject matter without overwhelming the main design elements.
            The background acts like a visual echo, reminding viewers that every
            new cover is built on decades of design history.
          </p>
          <p>
            The color palette features deep orange and soft blue gradients,
            inspired by vinyl reflections and music’s warmth and rhythm.
            Paired with clean black typography, the system feels both modern
            and nostalgic.

            Deliverables included:

      <p>
            - Logo system
      </p>
            <p>
            - 11x17 poster
      </p>
            <p>
            - Mailer and ticket design
      </p>
            <p>
            - Instagram carousel with motion
      </p>
      <p>
            - 3D promotional item (Bluetooth speaker)
      </p>
      <p>
            - Gift shop bag
      </p>
      <p>The completed identity, Sleeve Stories: The History of Album Covers,
        tells a visual story about music’s design legacy. Each component,
        from print to digital to 3D, reflects the exhibit’s core idea: that
        album covers are art forms in their own right, shaping how we see and
        experience music. The gradient “record” motif and background grid of
        classic covers tie every piece together, posters, banners, tickets,
        and social media graphics, into a cohesive and memorable system.
        The final designs create a sense of movement, rhythm, and layered
        storytelling that mirrors the experience of listening to an album itself.

    <!-- REFLECTION -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="case-panel case-panel--narrow">
          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <p>
            Through Sleeve Stories, I learned the importance of creating a design
            system that functions seamlessly across multiple forms of media.
            Developing this project taught me how consistency in typography, color,
            and composition builds recognition while allowing flexibility for
            different contexts, from printed posters to digital carousels and 3D
            promotional pieces. I realized that a well-structured system not only
            ensures visual harmony but also makes it easier to expand and adapt a
            brand without losing its identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also helped me refine my process, from research and sketching, to digital
            refinement and mockups. And it showed how storytelling can guide visual decisions
            at every stage of a project.
